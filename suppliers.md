[Stove Ready Wood](/) is a self-certification scheme for suppliers of firewood in
the UK. We publish logo images and informational PDF leaflets on this website 
to promote responsible wood burning. This material is copyrighted.

However, if you ensure that you supply firewood which has been dried to 20%
moisture content or less, you are welcome to use the Stove Ready Wood logo,
the information leaflet for buyers, and the term "Stove Ready Wood" in your
advertising and labelling. You do not need further permission from us to
do that, and we will not charge you for this now or in the future.

Using our material to promote the supply of wet wood with a moisture content
of greater than 20% may lead to prosecution by your local council's Trading Standards
office.

## Firewood leaflet

This [colour PDF leaflet](/srw-info-leaflet.pdf) is suitable for giving to people burning your
firewood, and should also print well in black and white.

In England, the [Air Quality (Domestic Solid Fuels Standards) (England) Regulations 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1095/contents/made)
require that anyone selling firewood in units of more than two cubic metres
must provide advice to buyers on drying firewood. This is required even if
the firewood already has a moisture content below 20%. The regulations
specify the wording of the advice, and this is included in the second box in
the PDF leaflet. The first box on the leaflet gives advice about the
seasoned, 20% or drier firewood that you are providing, as a Stove Ready Wood
supplier. 

You may find the leaflet useful even when you are not legeally required to 
provide the advice, and similar regulations are being discussed in Scotland, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland.
