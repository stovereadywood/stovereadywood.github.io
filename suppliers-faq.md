[Stove Ready Wood](/) is a self-certification scheme for suppliers of firewood
in the UK. This page answers some common questions about the scheme from 
suppliers.

## Q&A for suppliers

* **How can I use the Stove Ready Wood logo?**
  
  If you ensure that you supply firewood which has been dried to 20% 
  moisture content or less, you are welcome to use the Stove Ready Wood 
  logo in your advertising and labelling of that firewood. You do not 
  need further permission from us to do that, and we will not charge you 
  for this now or in the future, or withdraw your license to use the 
  image.

* **Why would I use the Stove Ready Wood logo when it is not legally required?**

  Stove Ready Wood is a voluntary self-certification scheme, but by using it
  when selling firewood you are making a promise to your customers that
  your firewood is of 20% moisture or less.

* **What penalty is there for suppliers misusing the Stove Ready logo?**

  By using our logo you are declaring that you are supplying firewood with
  a moisture content of 20% or below. If you instead supply wet wood to
  a consumer who believes they will be receiving stove ready wood then you 
  will be in breach of the description of goods clauses of the 
  [Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1277/contents)
  and may be prosecuted by your local Trading Standards office. 

* **What is the relation between Stove Ready Wood and Woodsure's Ready to Burn scheme?**

  They are separate schemes with different purposes. Stove Ready Wood provides
  a recognisable way for suppliers to declare that their firewood
  has been properly seasoned to 20% moisture or less. We aim to promote the
  responsible use of firewood in the UK, for no financial gain for ourselves.

  Ready to Burn aims to be a statutory monopoly, which requires suppliers to
  submit to an expensive and largely meaningless testing process run by 
  Woodsure/HETAS. As wood is a natural, variable product, it is pointless to
  test the dryness of a few logs each year in a lab. It is not like testing 
  one of a series of identical manufactured products coming off a production
  line. 

* **What is your position on firewood regulation?**

  We believe that firewood regulation is a simple weights and measures
  problem which should be administered by local Trading Standards offices.
  The heavy-weight registration system which Woodsure/HETAS have successfully 
  lobbyied for in England is unnecessary and will hamper the use of 
  carbon-neutral woodfuel. It will have particularly severe impact on the 
  management of small woodlands and the use of wood arising as a byproduct of
  farm management and arbicultural work. 

* **Who is behind Stove Ready Wood?**

  Stove Ready Wood has been created by individuals concerned about the 
  direction of firewood regulation in the UK, and its wider impact on 
  wood production and woodland management.
