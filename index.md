Firewood suppliers who are part of the Stove Ready Wood scheme have
undertaken to supply properly seasoned firewood with a moisture content of
20% or less. This firewood can be used straightaway without further
seasoning. 

You may have received a copy of our 
[information leaflet](/srw-info-leaflet.pdf) which gives some basic advice
about using firewood safely and legally.

If you are a firewood supplier, [this page](/suppliers) explains how you 
can participate in this self-certification scheme, which we are operating 
to promote responsible wood burning in the UK and is without any
registration or other fees.
